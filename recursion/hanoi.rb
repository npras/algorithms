#The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

#Only one disk can be moved at a time.
#Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
#No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
#With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
